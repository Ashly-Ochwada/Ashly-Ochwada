Hi, I’m Ashly W. Ochwada, a Software Developer, GIS Specialist, and Data Analyst with a strong foundation in UI/UX Design and User Research.

I work across a range of modern technologies, including JavaScript (Node.js, Next.js), Python, Django, Kotlin (Android), TypeScript, REST APIs, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL. My toolkit also includes geospatial tools (WebGIS, GIS Analysis), data visualization platforms (Tableau, Excel, Jupyter Notebooks), and design systems to craft intuitive user experiences.

I'm currently deepening my expertise in Data Analysis, Geospatial Intelligence, and Quality Assurance Engineering—expanding my problem-solving abilities and sharpening my cross-domain skills.

Whether it’s developing software, analyzing spatial data, or designing user-centered systems, I bring a balance of creativity, technical rigor, and a user-first mindset to every project. I’m passionate about building ethical, scalable, and impactful tech solutions that solve real-world problems.

Curious to collaborate, exchange ideas, or connect? Let’s talk!
