Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ashly W. Ochwada, and I have a background as a Software Developer/Data Analyst. In addition, I'm well-versed in UI/UX design and User Research. My skill set includes JavaScript (NodeJS, NextJS), Python, Django, Postgresql, SQL, Kotlin, Tableau, Excel, and Jupyter Notebooks. You can find most of my projects on my GitHub profile.

Currently, I'm focusing on expanding my knowledge of SQL and Quality Assurance Engineering. Learning these areas will complement my existing expertise and broaden my career prospects.

I consider myself ambitious, open-minded, and realistic, always striving to exceed goals. I find motivation in the transformative impact that technology has on our lives. As a software developer transitioning into data analysis, I take pride in my persistence, diligence, and empathy. I strongly believe in developing ethical and responsible solutions to address the most critical challenges we face today.

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out. I'm dedicated to helping and supporting others in any way I can!
